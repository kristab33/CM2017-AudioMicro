# CM2017-AudioMicro
Phase Vocoder Based Audio Microscope from my Stir Trek 2017 Talk "Building an Audio Microscope Vol. 2"

An update to my Codemash 2017 Talk "Building an Audio Microscope"

This runs on PureData (PD) by Miller Puckette and the patch itself is based upon the Phase Vocoder engine created by Miller Puckette. 

Getting Started: 

1. Download latest version of PD from here: Http://puredata.info
2. Clone my patch and libraries from my github  here: https://github.com/kristab33/CM2017-AudioMicro
3. Update the kbStartPvoc.bat file with the path to your PD (whereever you installed it) and KBLib folders (should be okay as is), respectively.
4. Double click kbStartPVoc.bat to Start ! 


Also you can refer to my presentation CodemashAudioMicroscope2017-KCampbell.pptx for an overview!

Or my updated presentation StirTrekAudioMicro2017Vol2-KCampbell.pptx
